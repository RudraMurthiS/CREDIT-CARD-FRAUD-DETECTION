# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION
I completed a credit card fraud detection project during my Codesoft internship, where I built a machine learning model to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine. I addressed class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE, trained models like Logistic Regression and Random Forests, and evaluated them using precision, recall, and F1-score.
